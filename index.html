                <p>Hey! I’m Jonathon Austing, a UX/UI Designer with a background in Health Science. I know what you are thinking… these don’t really go together. This is what makes me me. With my background in Health Science, I have a different perspective and mindset when it comes to problem solving. Allowing more brainstorming sessions to happen and more outcomes/solutions. I am incorporating my UX/UI knowledge with my Health Science background to help individuals in need.</p>

                    <p>In today's world, working with a team is not something out of the ordinary. Being able to work well within a group setting is becoming more and more necessary. It brings to life great ideas and allows the team to create a better product.</p>

                    <h3>Prototyping</h3>
                    <p>With prototyping comes great responsibility. The use of wireframes is the key factor as to what the idea of the site or app is and what it will potentially look like. Prototyping is the framework that drives the coding afterwards, making sure the layout is relevant and empathetic to the user.</p>

                    <h3>Research</h3>
                    <p>Research is one of the main sources of information that your design and the project is based off of. Without research the project is subjective. Research adds factual evidence as to why you are designing a certain way.</p>

                        <p>Within this project the team was instructed to brainstorm and think of a niche app that is new and not already developed. Within this project the team conducted research and prototyped out the design in  a mid-fidelity prototype.</p>

                        <p>This project started with the team coming together and looking at non-profit sites that we were passionate about. Lighthouse of Central Florida was an organization in our area that we have all had connection to in some way. From there we took their site and redesigned their layout as well as making it responsive for mobile.</p>
